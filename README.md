# NeuroSynth AI

NeuroSynth AI is an advanced project that leverages MRI image data and Large Language Models (LLM) to detect and analyze brain tumors. This project combines the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction with LLMs to generate detailed and insightful medical reports.

## Overview

Brain tumors can be life-threatening and early detection is crucial. NeuroSynth AI aims to aid medical professionals by providing an automated solution to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scans and generate comprehensive reports detailing the findings.

## Features

- **MRI Image Processing**: Utilizes CNNs to extract features from MRI scans.
- **Tumor Classification**: Identifies and classifies different types of brain tumors.
- **Detailed Reports**: Uses LLMs to generate detailed medical reports based on MRI scan analysis.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use interface for uploading scans and retrieving reports.
